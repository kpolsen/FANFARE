Welcome to the documentation of FANFARE!
========================================

FANFARE stands for 'Fast Assessment Numerical tool for Frequency Analysis of Renewable Energy integration scenarios' and can be applied to power system timeseries data of both real and simulated scenarios. 

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this code, is to quantify the need for flexibility in a system with significant share of variable renewable energy (VRE) and an offset between electricity consumption and VRE generation. This offset is often called residual load, and it can contain fluctuations on different timescales. In order to handle these fluctuations in a fossil-free future, solutions must be found in terms of energy storage (ES) and demand response (DR). Many of these solutions are already well on their way to being fully implemented, but each typically work on specific timescales, as illustrated for ES in the figure below.

In order to disentangle the residual load on different timescales, FANFARE adopts a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) analysis. This has often been done before in power system analysis - see for instance [Frunt et al. 2010](), [Arrigo et al. 2017](https://www.tib.eu/en/search/id/ieee%3Adoi~10.1109%252FISGTEurope.2017.8260312/Fourier-transform-based-procedure-for-investigations/), [Oh 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148117309904) and [Heggarty et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261919302107).

FANFARE consists of a set of methods that can be applied to timeseries data of residual load, in order to study the flexibility requirements on different timescales. 
These methods are illustrated in the flow chart below.
